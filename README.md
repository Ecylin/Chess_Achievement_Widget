# Chess_Achievement_Widget
Checks achievements on Chess.com and determines how many are left and in which order it'd be best to tackle them

This widget will take the username of the user, analyze the HTML file of their achievements page (https://chess.com/awards/[profile_username]/achievements), and determine how many achievements are left and which ones.

Ideally, the widget will also recommend which achievements are easiest to complete as well as which ones are more difficult, bugged, or impossible to get.
